# intelmkl_environment-setup_script
This repo contains the proper environment setup script for intel MKL for intel (ILP64)x64 environment variable setup
The actual intel mkl library vars.bat to set up environment variables doesn't work.
This is a custom batch script to install OneMKL environment variable on system environment.But specifically for x64 arch and (ILP64) instead of(LP64)
